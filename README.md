# path_visualizer
manueltr.github.io/path_visualizer/

This is my first ever JavaScript project/code. Having just started to learn JavaScript, I wanted to code something challenging. I got the idea for the project from Clément Mihailescu on Youtube.


I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery to create it.

Functionality
* I added the following algorithms to choose from:
	* Breadth-first search
	* Depth-first search
	* Greedy best-first search
	* A* search
	* Dijkstra's

*  A maze generation function that is based on Prism's algorithm
* A clear board function
* Option to change speed, and a toggle to add and remove walls
* You can drag and move the start and end nodes, and after running the algorithm, you can also move them in order to immediately see how the algorithm's path would change with respect to the new node location.
